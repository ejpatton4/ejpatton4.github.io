## What is Data Science and What do Data Scientists Need to Know?

Data science is a bit of an ambiguous term. When I tell people close to me that becoming a data scientist is a career ambition of mine I am often met with questions about what exactly that is and my response is usually, *“If statistics and computer science came together and had a baby, that baby would be data science.”* I also like how [this](https://medium.com/odscjournal/data-scientists-versus-statisticians-8ea146b7a47f) article describes it which is, *“A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.”* Both of these quotes are getting at the same idea, a data scientist is someone who uses computer programming (usually the R, SAS, or Python programming languages) to apply statistical analysis techniques to derive some insights about data. Is a data scientist a statistician? Not exactly. Is a data scientist a computer scientist? Not exactly. However, a data scientist needs to know enough about both of these areas to converse with people who are those things and to meld them together perfectly for the problem they are trying to solve.

## Comparing Data Scientist and Statisticians.

First and foremost (and maybe obviously) statisticians are experts in the field of statistics. This includes in depth knowledge of the theory behind various statistical analysis techniques. Data scientist don’t really need that much depth of knowledge in regard to the theory of statistical analysis (it doesn’t hurt them if they do have this knowledge, they just don’t need it as much), they do however need to know how to apply that theory. Data scientists apply statistics to data through programming languages, which a statistician may or may not need to be able to do. Personally, I don’t consider myself expert enough in either computer science or statistics to label myself as either a data scientist or a statistician, however, I I have some knowledge and background with programming, and I have taken a few graduate level statistics courses. If I am in either bucket, I believe that makes me more in the data scientist category than the statistician category. 

## My Future.

I am in the process of applying to the [Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University]( https://analytics.ncsu.edu/), if admitted I will be a candidate for a Master of Science in Analytics degree. After I hopefully earn that degree, I would then feel comfortable calling myself a data scientist. Once I am a practicing data scientist I am hoping to find a company that is willing to pay for more education for me as I would also like to add more depth to my knowledge of both parents of the ”data science baby”.
