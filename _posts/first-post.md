Hello! My name is Evan and I am making this as a practice for blogging on GitHub!

I love sports and first got interested in programming and statistics because of this.

NC State, Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bears, and the Chicago Bulls take up most of my free time in one way or another. 


The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
