## General

Hi! My name is Evan Patton and I am creating this GitHub Blog as an assignment for **ST 558** at *NC State University*.

I graduated from NC State in 2018 with a degree in Business Administration - Finance, right around the time I graduated however, I realzied I was more interested in statistics and data science. Since that point I have been working to get into that field of study, hence why I am in this course! 
Currently I am in the [Applied Statistics and Data Management Graduate Certificate Progam](https://online-distance.ncsu.edu/program/graduate-certificate-in-applied-statistics-and-data-management/) for which this is my last course. Sometime in the next few weeks I will be applying to the [Masters of Science in Analytics](https://analytics.ncsu.edu/) program also here at NCSU. After that I hope to start my career in sports analytics.

### Hobbies

Things I like to do in my free time include:  
* Learning about history, in fact I just got my copy of *Hero of Two Worlds: The Marquis de Lafayette in the Age of Revolution* By Mike Duncan.  
* Watching sports, mostly the Chicago Sports teams (Cubs not White Sox) and NC State.
* Analyzing football data in R.
* Exploring Raleighs many nature trails with my wife and two dogs.

### Pictures

Here is a picture of the most photogenic dog on the planet, my choclate labrador Whiskey!
